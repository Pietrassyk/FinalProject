       "\"we should criminalize Blast me because it's a kidney hate speech and because it leads to public disorder and resentment between religious groups. So let's start by talking about what, exactly, we're going to criminalize, because we're not gonna criminalize every single kind of blast. So if someone is just like an atheist and they say, I don't believe in God, possibly in some kind of public setting those aren't the people that we're going to prosecute. And that's not the kind of things that were worrying about what we're talking about, our people who are outwardly insulting people who may say things like God is evil, God is hateful or people who desecrate some kind of holy objects through people who will like, for example, burn a Koran or trying to, like, burn like a like a crumb click or burn some kind of cross things like that, things that I think truly embody a kind of hatred for religion on God. Let's start by talking about why these things were necessary first because it's a kidney hate speech. So it's generally accepted that speech rights are obviously important, but nevertheless not absolute on maybe not in America, but most parts of the world. Hate speech is banned, and the reason it's band is because it's essentially a way to, like verbalize violence against the window. In a lot of ways, it's similar to bullying and that the point of it is not so much to like, rationally exchange ideas. The point of it is to hurt somebody, and I think when the point of your speeches to hurt someone very deeply, that kind of speech is obviously not something that we just have to protect, and it can be bad. So let's talk about why blasphemy meets this kind of a qualification. I think it's quite obvious that it does, because no matter what your opinions on religion are, it's quite clear that there's billions of people around the world who believe deeply in their religion, whatever it may happen to be. And that's incredibly important because when you do something that could be deeply insulting to someone like Burn a Koran in a lot of ways your attack, the core of a lot of people's identity, and that is very, very hurtful. It's in a lot of ways, like you're punching someone in the face. It's very hurtful for them, and it's something that we don't have to tolerate. Um, but the next thing that I want to talk about is about the public disorder that can happen for these kinds of things. So in addition to a lot of places, you're able to bend hate speech because it's akin to tryingto like harm someone emotionally. Um, one of the other kinds of speech that we don't allow is incitement, So I think that when you do a lot of when you do a lot of them or extreme blasphemous things, one of the reasons you're often trying to do this is because you're trying to express your hatred and you're trying to incite a reaction. So, with a pastor in Gainesville, Florida wants to burn a Koran on television and then put the video on YouTube. It's in a lot of ways, the same thing, like when Isis decides to behead people and then put the video on YouTube, they're trying to get a reaction or trying to incite a response on. They're trying to incite a lot of circumstances, some kind of violent response, So these things are obviously very bad, and these things are bad because they put people's lives at risk. When you do something that you know is going to offend people so dearly that these people might riot, these people might like do something like very, very bad. Um, that's a good enough reason to say no, you can't do it because in a lot of ways you have moral culpability for the harms and the damage Is there going to happen because it is incitement? You don't have to directly say, I want to see you like like rip this building down or burn this building down for it to be incitement. If you create the environment in which you're very likely going to see this consequence, God is more than sufficient. So for those reasons, we should criminalize blasphemy.\""
